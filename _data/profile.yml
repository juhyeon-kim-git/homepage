  <p>
I am a Ph.D. student at Seoul National University, conducting research in causal discovery, large language models (LLMs). 

My work is broadly focused on building reliable, interpretable, and generalizable causal reasoning systems, particularly in settings where data is sparse, non-stationary, or embedded in unstructured text.

My early research addressed automated extraction of causal relationships from text using part-of-speech–based data augmentation, which I presented as the first author at **CASE@EMNLP 2022**. Since then, I have been actively exploring how **pre-trained language models can be leveraged to incorporate prior knowledge into causal structure learning**, co-authoring papers presented at **NeurIPS 2024 (Causality and Large Models Workshop)** and currently under review at **IEEE Access**.

Alongside this, I am the lead inventor of a causal discovery framewor that integrates LLMs into graph learning pipelines. 

My recent efforts involve both theoretical and empirical investigations of **non-stationary time series causal discovery** and **spatio-temporal causal discovery**.

In addition, I am developing a series of studies on **LLM citation reliability**, including saliency-based methods, and on **diffusion-based causal discovery using mixture-of-experts (MoE)** architectures.

My research aims to bridge language understanding, causal inference, and dynamic systems — with the long-term goal of building robust AI systems that can reason about change, uncertainty, and cause-effect relationships in real-world settings.
